# Sales and Financial Analytics

## Overview
This project involves a hardware company that sells PCs, Mice, Printers, and peripherals. The business operates through two customer segments: **Brick & Mortar (Croma)** and **E-Commerce (Flipkart)**, managed via three channels: **Retailer**, **Distributor**, and **Direct**. The objective of this project is to assess **Sales** and **Financial Health** to support business expansion.

## Objective
The project provides actionable insights through two primary reports:
1. **Customer Performance**
2. **Market Performance vs. Target**

## Process

### ETL and Data Modeling
- Data is sourced from the following datasets: **Fact_sales_monthly**, **Dim_product**, **Dim_market**, **Dim_customer**, and a dynamically generated **dim_date** table:
  ```powerquery
  = {Number.From(#date(2018, 9, 1)) .. Number.From(#date(2024, 8, 1))}
  ```
- The transformed data is modeled using a **star schema** for efficient analysis.

### Key DAX Measures
- **Net Sales Amount**: `=SUM(fact_sales_monthly[net_sales_amount])`
- **Net Sales for 2023**: `=CALCULATE([net sales], dim_date[FY] = "2023")`
- **Net Sales Growth (2024 vs. 2023)**: `=DIVIDE([net sales 24], [net sales 23], 0)`
- **Net Sales Target (2024)**: `=SUM(ns_target_2024[ns_target])`

### Reports Delivered
1. **Customer Performance**
2. **Market Performance vs. Target**
3. **Division Report**
4. **Top & Bottom Products**
5. **New Products in 2024**
6. **Top 10 Products**

## Finance Analytics
Additional data, such as **Fiscal Year** and **Performance Targets for 2024**, enable the creation of key financial reports:
1. **Profit & Loss (P&L) by Fiscal Year**
2. **P&L by Month & Quarter**
3. **Gross Margin (GM%) by Quarter**
4. **P&L for Markets**
